# Cinema Ticketing System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the software engineering artifacts for the "Cinema Ticketing System," developed as part of the Software Engineering I course at Shiraz University. The project aims to analyze and design a robust online platform for browsing movies, booking tickets, and managing cinema showtimes.

The system is modeled using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and documented in accordance with standard software engineering practices.

## Course Information
- **Course:** Software Engineering I
- **University:** Shiraz University
- **Instructor:** Mrs. Farnoosh Ma'navi
- **Student:** Alireza Bagher
- **Date:** November 2025

## Repository Structure

This project is organized into three main phases, reflecting the incremental development process:

### 1. Requirements Engineering (Phase 1)
Focuses on identifying actors and defining functional requirements through Use Cases.
- **Artifacts:**
  - Use Case Diagram (System Boundary, Actors, and Relationships)
  - Detailed Use Case Scenarios (Basic and Alternative Flows)
- **Key Use Cases:** Purchase Ticket, Cancel Ticket, Schedule Showtime.

### 2. Vision and Scope (Phase 2)
Defines the high-level business goals, stakeholders, and core features of the system.
- **Artifacts:**
  - Vision Document (Problem Statement and Solution Overview)

### 3. Domain Modeling (Phase 3)
Illustrates the conceptual classes, attributes, and relationships within the problem domain.
- **Artifacts:**
  - Domain Model Class Diagram
- **Key Entities:** Movie, Showtime, CinemaHall, Ticket, Customer.

## Tools Used
- **Enterprise Architect (EA):** Used for UML modeling (Use Case and Class diagrams).
- **Microsoft Word:** Used for documentation and reporting.

## Note
All documentation and models are presented in English to maintain compatibility with international software engineering standards and modeling tools.
